And the King,beholding one mightier than himself in Italy, called Mussolini to hisside. It was the King for Mussolini or Mussolini himself might havebeen crowned King by his soldierfollowers.In eight years Mussolini has madeItaly over. He has broken up cumbersome and idle estates into productive . moll farms, reclaimed millions of acres cL waste lands, harnessed the waters of the mountains,built highways all over Italy, putships unpon the seven seas and filledthe air with Lying machines. Makeno mistake about this Mussolini; heis the most dynamic personality onearth today. Beggars and streetwalkers are nowhere apparent inItaly today. He has made Italiansconscious of their illustrious ancestry. Much cf the glory of ancient Rome was buried under itshills and sidewalks. Mussolini hasunearthed it and is making Romemere wonderful every day.

The year 1789 was one of thoseepochs, when a peculiar mortality prevailedamong distinguished characters. 1559 wasstill more remarkable, including a smallportion ot the preceding and subsequentyears, being less than 15 months, there died,a pope, an emperor, two kings of France,king of England, a king of Portugal, a kingof Denmark, a queen dowager of Poland,queen of England, queen Mary of Hungary,queen Eleanor, the doge and patiiarch otVenice, thedukeof Ferrara, 13 cardinals,and several other persons of great distinction. Sickness has prevailed throughout theU. S. in a greater degree for the last yearthan it has probably for 20 years beforeconsequently its victims in the higher classes of society n ust have been great as themortality was extended. We notice andfeel the death of a great man more than onein common circumstances, as during his lifehe has occupied more of the public attentionand regard. Rhen a light in town is extinguished, its loss i« soon and extensively perceived, and doubly felt too, if we have beenaccustomed to look olten towards it, or todepend upon its beams, for pleasure or utility.

They unlortunately involved a question, too deeply affecting particular interests,to admit ol much diversity of opinion, exceptamongst persons inhabiting different sectionscf the Union. In the House of Delegates,an incidental question was raised on the subject of the right of instructions, and was decided without much discussion, and by a verylarge majority, in favor ot the authoritywhich the Legislature have chosen to usurp,in violation of the rights, no less of the people themselves, than of the general government.A bill for repealing, rather for materiallyaltering the usury laws of the state, was yesterday discussed and rejected in the Houseof Delegates. The stay law was today onthe carpet, and (as my Loid Coke says) willmost probably “ be bandied to and fro” forseveral days to come. Its fate is less certainthan formerly ; but I still think it will berejected.question has excited more interest ineither house, than that relating to the removal ol Piince YV illiam Court House. In theHouse of Delegates it was decided, after avery warm contest, by an almost unanimousvote in favor of removal ; and in the Senate,the same result was obtained in a vote of 16to 5, alter a discussion occupying the greater part of two days.A bill has passed, authorising the Boardof Public Works to subscribe (l think,)25,00U dollars to the road leading from theFalls bridge to the Leesburg road. Is Alexandria asleep on this subject ? or will sheavail berseH of a law which Las passed theHouse ot Delegates, and wiil certainly passthe Senate, lor uniting the Leesburg andLittle Rivr Turnpike roads ?The bill respecting toe officers cf incorporated companies, residing in th* district, liasbeen recommitted, and, of course, is yet tobe acted on- What its fate will be, 1 cannottell ; my own impression is, that it will passthe house, and be rejected in th* Senate. (The Little River turnpike company havefailed in their application for permission tostop up their sideways. It was reported unreasonable by the committee, and rejectedat once in the house.Defalcation is the order of the day here.The state loss !>j Y the I reasurer is estimatedat upwards of 100,000 dollars.

Hiseulogiurn on the jinmortal Washington, is ot itself a masterpiece of eloquence, in his character ot Benaparte , he paints the actions ot that woflderfui personage in language at once sublime and imposing : with all the chasttnelftand precision of an historian, he recapitulates bis movements from the cradle to thcamp—trom the camp to the lastly from the elevated station of an emperor to that of an exile and iug can be supplied with handrailing, cut to by confirming a truth, that power unsupportxny dimensions, at a short notice. e d by virtue is liable to wither and decay.His speeches on the various Crim.

Charta olEngland ; and it the facsimiles of the signatures of the patriots who signed it werepublished in America, it would serve to gratify a curiosity, at least as laudable as thatwhich calls for imitations of the correspondents of Junius or of the aristocracy thatwrested the English Charter from the reluctant monarchs of the day.We are firmly persuaded that the morethe principles ol our Declaration of Independence are spread out before the eyes of theworld, the more they will be admired, byforeign nations as well as our own : and every innocent and honet device that may serveto attract attention toward them, wialso, to promote the great cause of public liberty. Such an embellishededition as willrender it an ornament to an apartment, willhave a tendency to spread the knowledge ofits contents, among those who would otherwise have turned their thoughts but liglJysubject. Such an edition willtowards theserve to place it continually under the eyeof man, woman, and child in a will associate the pleasurable ideas of elegance and ornament with the history of thetransaction itsell—and familiarize thoseprinciples which form, or ought to form, thevery bond and cement of political society.Nor is it of small moment that such an edttion, well executed, will serve as a specimenof the state ot the Fine Arts amongst us atthe present day.

In allother political fubjes a writer may deduce his arguments and leading principles, from public utility, and from a number of moral maxims, whichthe couitefy of the world hath for many ages allowed to be facred ; but on attempting I find thefefources fail me ; to fupply the want, I mull haverecourfe, in my own meditations, to the fituation,abilities, particular interefls, and paflions of certain characters ; this method of actual experiment, I conceive to be a fure way of coming tothe truth, but the progrefs is flow, and the publicpatience may be exhaufled before the completionof this undertaking.The lafl antifederal fubjetft, which I have hadunder infpeetion, furnifhed me fome curious information in what philofophers have called, thefcale of being, or a feries of exigencies with incheating fenfe and reafon, from an oylter up tothofe genii of the air, which can play with mountains and hurricanes as a child doth with a rattlebox. To my great fuprize I found this gentleman, under a natural neceffity, of being antifederal or difhoneit, and I can now allure my readers upon the llrength of this experiment, thatthe popular opinion of at leaft a linall degree ofroguery, being at the bottom of antifederalifm,is not true in all cafes, for I have found one hoiiellman in this clafs of people, and whenever 1 findanother, notice fhall be given of the difeovery.In this examination nothing appeared differentfrom what is found in other men, except a A rangelimitation of all the feeing and judging facultieswithin very narrow dimenfions.The mind aCted and judged vigoroufly on linallobjects, but was utterly incapable of extendingits views to the policy of a nation, or the benefitof fo great a number of people as inhabit theUnitec?States ; neither could he conceive any kincof advantage from a communication between pcopie fo diflant in fituation. He feared much thefame confequences from the union, as might happen from building a bridge to the moon, whichwould only ferve as a pafs way for lunatics ancother dangerous enemies. After attemptingwhole day to enlarge his underflanding, I fountmy work in vain, and that no man can fee further than nature ha« enabled him. From thishave taken the hint to form a fcale of minds,which I have thrown into four grand divifious, viz.Parifh intellects,County intellects,State intellects, andFederal intellects.The fubdivjfions in each of thefe clafies, mudbe formed from future experiments, and when thefcale is compleated, I think it will be an infallible guide ro all honed electors.I would humbly propole to the refpectable public, that when the fcale is completed, the partyterms of whig and tory, federal and antifederal,republican and democrat, Ihould be thrown afide, and every mans political opinions be defcribed by the fcale of his intellects. Names ofmens invention caufe much offence in the world but I think no man can be offended, when we deferibe him by the dandard of nature itfelf.Where there is no reafon for blame there oughtnot to be any odium. Nature has made monkies,men and angels—dill we know that a monkey isnot a man, nor a man an angel—each of thefegrades are made to fee, move and be happy inthe communion of their own order ; and fhouldwe deferibe to a monkey the community of angels, with their conditution and laws, Pug wouldvery honeftly be antifederal, and declare offfrom the union.O N the 12th of February, at fcven in the evening, a tremendous fire broke out at PointPetre, in Guadaloupe, and was not extinguishedtill midnight.

This may feem the moreftrange, as few people approve ot the fafhionsthey are compelled to follow. It is not eafy toaccount for it, that in a land of freedom wheremen are left^ in 1110ft refpedts, to purfue whattheir inclination dictates, fo many perfons fhouldlead a life totally the reverfe ot what they with.Amanfeems, as it were, to give up his natural independence of temper, the moment he begins tolive in fathion.

The privilege of chofing for ones felf is furrendered byevery one, who would be fuppofed tafhionable.A man of finifhed tafte mult feldom eat what helikes, or wear what is convenient for him. As nogreat harm refults from this kind of felf denial,in a general way, it is not my intention to complain of it. There is however fome regard to bepaid to reafon and nature, in the regulation ofour drefs. Though tafte cannot be managed byany rules which admit of demonftration, there isneverthelefs, in fome things, a natural proprietywhich ought not to be overlooked.For inftance, drefs Ihould be accommodated tothe feafon and climate. The laws offafhion cannever control the conftitution of our bodies infuch a manner, that the people of a cold climatecan,without real impropriety,borrow their modesof drefs, from the inhabitants of a warmer one.French fafhions may be, in themfelves, fuperiorto thole of any other nation, but they illy applyto thelituation of the Northern parts of the United Srates. The furrs of Ruffia are much betteradapted to our winters, than the filks of France.It is not a matter of confequence in point of expence, what country we imitate in our drefs, becaufe if we arc induftrious, we can afford to wearwhat we pleafe. But when we conlider how thehealth is affected, it becomes an affair of feriousmoment, to whom we look for direction in forming our tafte. It would difeover more real goodfeitfe to form our own—but as this would be troublefonie, I do not expetft we fhall ever be fo independent. Foreigners remark that the ladies ofAmerica lofe their bloom, and impair their vivacity at a very early period of life. I am of theopinion that the irregularity of our climate is theprincipal caufe of this unfortunate fadl. Perhapsthis is a misfortune againft whi li there is no perfect remedy. The effedtsof it, however, maybepartly counteracted, and our women may prefervetheir health and vivacity much longer than theydo. There is no doubt, thata warmer drefs in theWinter,than is ufually worn by our females, wouldmeliorate their Conftitution, and contribute totheir happinefs.

At the iiuerct.uon of the five companies of Bruliel - volume* - he has refumed liispoll. To remove liVViruft, he has been informed of the grand 1 lecret, till that time unknown, of connections formed with foreigncourts—thefe connections are not generally approved of, and it would appear that Mr. Van derNoots intereft is on the decline.The adherents of the revolution are dividedinto parties, which are differing more apd morefrom each o(her—the one party conlifts of thofewho with to fupport what is called the prefent confutation j that is to fay the arrangements bywhich the Affembly of the three Eftateshavc taken polleflion of the fovereiguty, without the confetti of the people, which conftitution tends to anoligarchy of the worft kind, a clerical oligarchy.In order to fupport this fyftem, the dates of Brabant refolved to adininifter an oath of fidelity tothe corps called fermens, foine of that body tookit whilft the greater part 1 efufed, requefting thatit fliould be printed, to fee whether it was conformable to the intereft of the country.

That certain refolutionswere read at a fecond meeting pallid at a former,which wet e confirmed and fent by an exprefs to theEmperor. That univerfal joy prevailed throughout the kingdom, from a report that the Emperor was about reinftating Hungary in all its ancient privileges and ufages.

All industrious democrats have got through with their comand hilled all up, except perhaps, here and there, apiece of stumpy new ground by the 18th of July.Well, have your horses held in the grass, and thenmount them and ride around to see how your neighbors and acquaintances, stand as to the elections.You have a hard struggle before you. The richmen, backed by ihe Bank influenc, are floodingthe country with lying pamphlets and papers in alldirections. They are holding their great LogCabin Hard Cider meetings all over the Union,with banners, and shouts, and huzzahs, to alarm youand browb at you. Remember, they have alwaysclapped their wings and crowed loud, before anelection as they do now. They cannot believe itpossible that, what they call ignorant country people, ehould be able to out number them at the pollsBut you will teach them in August next, that youare not to be f ightened by th< ir clamor; you willspare a little time, to spread information in yourneighborhoods, and counteract their false charges.See to it. See to it. See to it, f.iends of humanlibeitv. Be up and doing, for the good cause ofyour rights. Do not sleep on your posts. See thatevery inan goes to the polls, and swells with hisvote the overwhelming majority for your republicanfriend General Saunders.Bein in time, and look ahead to the flectionday in August, make your arrangements delihcrately, and be ready to teach your adversaries, whenthe day shall come, that your name is legion, in oldNorth Carolina. One honest iruzgle, and all willbe safe. Conquer. Conquer at all hazards, in August, for Governor, and the Legislature, and yourvictory will be the easier in November. Nail yourcolors to the mast and never give up the ship.It in needless to say that this is the way thefederalists will do; they always have done sotheir voters never fail to be at the polls,whilst the democrats are very often toothronged with work to go to the election.Bear it in mind,That the democrats never have lost the contest when they ALL turned out to the election.Dont forget this.Some men station themselves at the ballot boxon the day of election, to browbeat and overawe the poor men, who may happen to be INDEBT to them. Democrats will you sufferthis thing to be done? No, you must nevertamely bend to the tyrant oppressors yoke !you must be permitted to vote precisely asyou wish,* Unawetl by influence and tinbribed by gain.Stand at the PollsUntil the ballot box is closed, and see thatthe infirm democrats nre not kept away fromvoting by the crowd. Men are employed insome places to block up the polls and keepthe democrats away. AAatch well that theway is kept clear.DEMOCRATS, ORGANIZE !!!DEMOCRATS of the OLD NORTH STATEVA c put a SOLEMN Question to you ARE YOU PREPARED FOR THEBATTLE ?It comesoff” in a very few weeks and youhave but little time left for preparatory organization. The time most be usefully employed.Every District, County, anil precinct shouldhave its Committee to class the voters, andbring out every democrat to the polls. Letthis not be neglected, as it is all importantthat EY ERY MAN should be brought to thepolls.Be CarefulTo examine well and see that the ballot boxis empty when the voting commences. Byno means suffer yourselves to neglect this.There is more in it than strikes the eye atfirst sight. The most outrageous frauds willundoubtedly be committed upon the ballotboxes by the federalists this year. Take warning by your late August election. You knowthat squads of federalists would march fromone precinct to another, and vote at everyone. Again we caution and entreat you tosee to this thing at each place of voting.Count the Votesas soon as the polls are closed. Insist thatthis be done, and with open doors in everyinstance. Remember, freemen, that the ballot box is your only hope. It is there whereyour liberties will be preserved or lost. Ifyou suffer fraud to creep iuto the bollot boxat this trying crisis in our history, when themoney of the country is arrayed in open rebellion against its laws, and in open warfareagainst the people, you will soon feel thechains of despotism clanking upon your limbsyour boasted . liberties will soon take toBe at the PollsDemocrats; No matter whether it rains, hailsor snows, be at the polls, and be there at leasttwo hours before they are open. Talk to yourfriends—talk to the federalists—tell them thetruth—conviction always goes hand in handwith truth.When the polls are open Vote yourself and then LOOK OUT FORTHE REST. Be at hand all day, and ifthere be a democrat missing,Start out after him.Possibly he may be backward with his seeding and unable to lose the time required tog o to the place of voting. Send him alongand work for him yourself,that is fair and honorable toGet out the voters.FayettevilleFEMALE SEMINARY.I should express to its former patrons and friendsmy confidence, that in the hands of Mr. Spencer itwill be conducted with ability and faithfulness, onthe general plan heretofore pursued.

In England, when arsenicis sold in quantities of less than tenpounds, it is required by law to be colored with onethirtypecond part of itsweight of indigo, or onesixteenth ofits weight of soot; the object being torender any liquid to which the arsenicmight be added with murderous intentof a black or bluish color, and thus indicate the presence of something unusual. In Massachusetts and mostother States, any apothecary or otherperson who sells arsenic without thewritten prescription of a physicianmust keep a record of the date of suchsale, the amount sold, and the personor persons to whom delivered. Happily, the methods of detecting arsenicin animal substances are how so unerring and trustworthy that it is hardlywithin the range of possibility that aperson could come to his death by thispoison without its being easily detectedby a chemistthe; pro pom kd immigrationBOARD.We publish in this issue a well writtenarticle by the editor of the Land Journal,touching U ou a scheme whicli we regardas being worthy of the thoughtful con sideration, not only of the pres of thisregion but o f every individual who iseither directly or indirectly interested intbe prosperity and development ofnorthern Dakota? The author observss,and very sensibly too, that there arethousands scattered over tbe land who aredissatisfied with their surroundings andare contemplating a change. Now it is agenerally known fact that Kansas, Nebraska and Tsxas are constantly flooding thecountry with emmigration documents; ameans through which they successfullyreach this class of inquirers, who naturallyenough—having never heard of this richcountry—are led to purchase and settleupon their lands.Official reports show that Kansas soldmore land last season than either Dakota,Colorado, Texas or Nebraska. The causeis thus very reasonably attributed to thefact that it has done more advertisingthan any two of the states or territories mentioned, and not because itpossesses any marked superiority overthem. * Our correspondent also verytruthfully remarks that tho boards ofimmigration of these various states aredoing this advertising.

IBark op the Missouri River, >June 2d, 1880. )Life on the plains is not without itsbright side as well as its rough. At thiscamp, in order to enjoy the benefits of aband—a great number of the members ofcamp being musically inclined—and having some Gilmore genius” in our midst,we invented a model bass viol,” one of themost carious, perhaps, ever used. Inorder that you may have some idea of tLemanufacture, I shall explain its construction. An ordinary cracker box, with oneside—in this case the top—taken out; theneck and fingerboard extending throughthe box, two holes for the purpose beingcut in top and bottom, joining at thesame time the screw and tail piece. Fourstrings are made out of good strong chalkor fishing lines, a bridge, and the keys areinserted, you tune up, as on a good instrument, and you are in possession of asgood a bass viol as you ever heard. Thebow is made of a piece of hooppole, andthe same line used as strings on the instrument can be made applicable in constructing the bow. Our other instruments areviolin, fife, mouth harmonica, a tin bucket,used as a drum, a piece of sheet iron usedas a bass drum, a horse shoe used as a triangle, and last, but not least, a brass hornor trumpet.

D., 1879, in accordance with the provisions of an act ofthe Legislative Assembly of the Territoryof Dakota, relating to insurance companies, approved February 16th, 1877Whereas, on examination of the swornstatement of said company filed in thisoffice, I find that the said insurance company is possessed of the necessary amountof capital invested as required by law.Therefore I, E. A. Sherman, Auditor ofDakota Territory, do hereby certify thatsaid Insurance company is duly authorizedto transact the business of fire insurancein this territory, for the year ending Dec.31st, 1880, by agents properly appointed.S. K. McGnniss, Agent,Jamestown, Dakota.In testimony whereof, I have hereuntoSet my Hand and Seal, this 14th day ofJan., A. D. 1880. E. A. SHERMAN.By L. M. Pcrdy, Deputy. Auditor.those: claims.There are over fifteen jumpable treeclaims in Stutsman county, and fifty individuals ready to juinp‘ em” as soonas they are advised as to their location.It seems wrong to jump a mans claimbut in many cases it is not wrong. Aperson either has a right, or has no right.If he has lived up to the letter of the lawto the best of his ability the law will protect him. If be has not, the law doesnot recognize him at a claimant, and hehas no right to ask it to. There are hundreds of tree claims and homestead entries made by persons who do not intend,and never did intend to improve them,to any great extent; but simply hold themin any way they can until they advance toa desired figure, and then sell them out.This class of claimants and homesteadersare no better than any other class of government swindlers, and their Claim, whenjumpable, ought to be jumped. Thiscourse is damaging to every law abidingcitzens of the county, for the simple reason that the land they hold is not cultivated to a profitable extent by any one,and in nine cases out of ten, is of no morevalue to the county than so manyacres held by speculators of a differentstripe. The government does not givetheir land to persons to speculate withbut to cultivate, and unless they do sowe can see no reason why they shouldnot be jumped.Captive HummingBirds.In the time of the Montezumas, hummingbirds were tamed and kept in largeconservatories. Doctor Zipperlero, ofCincinnati, tells of two hummingbirdswhich strayed in May, a year ago, intothe house of a lady in that city and werecapturedThe lady, a friend of birds, resolvedto try the experiment of domesticatingthe little creatures, although she wasaware that such attempts ended usuallyin the death of the birds. She had nosuitable cage so she selected a largecandy jar, and fixed a perch inside. Inthe bottom sbe placed a boquet of flowers, and covered the open end with gauze.The flowers were renewed every day. Theconvolvulus, tropicolum, honeysuckle,and other flowers with a long calyx wereselected. A little honey was droppedinto every blossom.The birds began to sip the swet foodon the first day, humming above the flower cups, darting their tongues in andout among them swift as lightning.They also snapped at little insects anddevoured them. After some weeks theywere given some honey ihinncd withwater, in a small dish. They sat upontheir low perch and lapped the honeywith their tongues, like a dog drinkingwater.In a short time the birds were so tamethat the gauze that confined them wasremoved, and (hey flew about the roomwhile their glass palace was cleaned andfurnished with fresh flowers and honeybut as soon as this operation was finishedthey flew into the glass again, and beganeating the honey. If the lady took a napalter dinner, they perched themselvesupon her forehead, and enjoyed. theirsiesta thrre. They hummed about tbcroom for hours, halting for rest upon thefinger ot their friend, and dressing theirfeathers. For a change they would flyagain to the honey, but after a moment ary taste away they would go, flyingabout their friend. Towards eveningthey sought their perch in their glasspalace, and sang quick flute notes in thefinest pianissimo. They occasionallysnapped at 6mali insects, but their chieffood was honey, and later strong sugarwater, since the honey thinned withwater often settled to the bottom of thedish. They thrived finely ou the sugarwater, too. As the weather liecamcwarm in J unc, tlie gauze covering wasentirely removed from their glass palaceand the little creatures were given therange of the whole room, but their foodwas always placed in their old dwelling.Tna tiny birds were not at all timorous, even at first; they did not flutterabout anxious when their flowers wereremoved and fresh ones brought. Theireyes said plainly: We know you arcgood to us.” They thankfully appreciated the care of their protector, and,although they manifested no uneasinesswhen strangers were in the room, theycould not be induced to perch upon anyanybodys linger but tlia: of their tenderkeeper.At the end of September one of thembegan to be aiiiDg, and a few days afterwas found dead upon tbe floor. Theother pined from hour to hour, and whenthe cooler nights at the end of Octoberapproached it too succumbed to the unfriendly climate and to its plainly manifested homesickness.A DARING OUTLAW.LEADER OF BLACK JACKSGANG OF BANDITS.UcldFT p a Train SingleHanded andAfterward Fought a Dcspe>rate llattlewith Officers — Killed Two HundredMen.The notorious leader of the infamousBlack Jacks” gang of train robbeisand murderers, Tom Ketchum, nowlies ia the hospital of the penitentiaryat Santa Fe, N. M., seriously wounded,as the result of an encounter with officers of the law. Tom held up a trainsinglehanded and in the sequel to thiswas wounded and captured. It wasthe Colorado Southern express thatTom held up. The place selected wasnear Fulsom, on the northeast cornerof New Mexico. One night ns the express was puffing laboriously up gradethe engineer saw a light ahead givingthe signal to stop. When the trainslowed down Tom Ketchum jumpedinto the cab and, carelessly swinginga 45 Colt near the engineers nose,toldhim to obey all orders given during thenext few minutes. This, Tom said,would save heartaches in the engineershome and the intrusion of an undertaker in the family circle. Then heJumped off and tried to uncouple theengine, which was made impossible bythe steep grade. Failing in this, Tomwalked back to the WellsFargo express car and, thumping the door withthe butt of his Colt, demanded admittance. The messenger opened the doorand poked the muzzle of a Winchesterout into the dark and pulled the trigger. That put an end to the holdupthat night. Just how badly Tom wasshot Is not known, but he was wounded in a subsequent battle with UnitedStates Marshal Forakers posse and hewill not say how much damage themessenger did. As he declared theholdup off it is probable he was severely injured. The express pulled onand Tom Jumped his broncho andsought safety in the mountains. Theattempted robbery was soon known tothe officials and three days later Marshal Forakers men were hunting forTom in the uplands. They finally liltthe trail and followed it hack into thevery heart of the mountains. Herethey lost it and while discussing thebest move a report of a rifle split theair and one of the deputies fell out ofhis saddle. This was sufficient evidence of Toms presence in the vicinity, but not his exact whereabouts, asTom used smokeless cartridges. Another shot was heart and another deputy went to the ground. At this rateevery man In the posse would be cutdown without a ghost of a chance ofgetting a shot. The deputies, therefore, separated, and began to scout thebrush. A glint of sunshine playing onthe blue steel barrels of a Winchesterdiscussed Tom Ketchums position behind a big bowlder surrounded bybrushwood. Then the days proceedings began. The deputies shot at thatglint of sunshine playing along bluesteel; Tom shot at the deputies. Thedeputies dodged behind trees and rocksand shot wildly. Tom stayed wherehe was and made bulleyes. If Tomhadnt shelved his right arm a littletoo high in taking aim he would havebrought down a full mess of deputies.As it was a slug of lead as big as yourfinger tore through Toms shootingmember, and it took a few minutesto change his Winchester over to hisleft arm. In these short minutes thedeputies closed In on Tom and captured him. He was In a bad shape.His right arm was terribly broken andtorn and he was already suffering fromloss of blood. But he was game. Hooffered to take his left arm and beginthe performance all over again, whichproposition was respectfully declined.The next day when he was able to bemoved Tom was strapped to his broncho and taken to a train, ultimatelylanding in the penitentiary hospital atSanta Fe. Of Black Jacks\" gang ofthieves and cutthroats Tom Ketchumwas the leader. He was 35 years old,and in Texas, his native state, he isknown as the new Jesse James. Hestands 5 feet 10 inches In his stockingfeet and is built on the graceful linesof a tiger. He is as void of conscienceas the Winchester he carried. Hewould rather shoot a man than eatif the man be an officer of the law itwas more fun to kill him than to goto a dance. One of his boyhood pastimes was to hire in some convenientplace on the ranch in Texas and shootMexican herdsmen. When a lad hewas summoned as a witness in a lawsuit, and not knowing what the summons meant, and not caring to takeany chances, shot and killed the officer.After this he found it convenient tochange his residence, so he rode upinto New Mexico and Arizona. Herehe soon became a terror to everybodyin general and railroad and expresssompanies In particular. Ho admitsin a roundabout way that since 1S88he and his gang have stolen from postoffices, trains, stages and wayfarers$200,000 and killed 200 men.COLORADO NOTES.Fort Collins people are planning toInstitute Raspberry Day as a local hoiiday, to which visitors will be invited.Warden Hoyt, in response to the recommendation of the Board of Penitentiary Commissioners that lie be removed, has asked for an investigationof ids conduct of the institution.The county assessors in tlie southeastern counties of the state are aboutto make a test ease of the attemptsof cattlemen to escape taxation.

The cost of savingthe Union was fearful. The landwas liillocked with graves, theblood of heroes flowed on a hundred battlefields, the nation wasexhausted, but the flag was notfurled, and not a single star waslost from its azure field. The result, however, was worth all it cost.It was a struggle for integrity ofempire, and yet it was a struggleagainst imperialism. The triumphof the North made thrones acrossthe sea rock on their old foundations, and some, indeed, havefallen, while those which still remain have only been able to endureby granting a larger measure ofselfgovernment, to their subjects.Manhood has become a royal thingdue to the efforts of the Republicanparty to dignify and verify thesovereignty of manhood. Powerhas drifted down to tho masses,who became conscious of theirpower through the work of suchmen as Lincoln, Grant, Garfield,Harrison and McKinley, who, incamp, in battle and in tho councilsof the nation have made our country the envy of the world. Thopolicy of the Republican party hasgone on in ndvanco of the carrying some of the blessings ofliberty to peoples and countrieswho have never seen the banner ofglory and freedom. To chargeimperialism to the party whichwas conceived by freemen, wasrocked by liberty and grew to vigorous maturity on tho strong meatof personal sovereignty, is to distort history, deny the truth and betray the fact that the opponents ofthe party think a falsehood is better than the truth for campaignpurposes.A large part of Bryans St. Louisaudience on Saturday night left thehall long before he got through talking. This is ominous. In 189C lie heldcrowds for hours here, as he did elsewhere throughout tin* country. Nobody saw any of ills auditors leavehis meetings four years ago until heleft. The change is significant. Inthe first place, the curiosity whichled persons to go and see Bryan fouryears ago is necessarily less activenow. In the second place, the chancesof ills election are much fainter nowthan they seemed to be in 1800.

Thewriter Is convinced that hens frequently become overfat from under exercise and the feeding of too mud!.orn. He remembers one such henhat when dressed yielded five poundsof worthless fat and was reduced bythe removal of the fat from ten to flvspounds In weight. Not only are suchbirds rendered worthless for egg proJuction, but they also are renderedworthless for anything else. An overabundance of fat Is an unhealthy indication and opens the way to the coning of various diseases. It Is as detrimental to tho breeding fowl as It itto the laying fowl.OUR POSTAL SYSTEM.President Tafts recommendation that the rates on second classpostage matter he increased tomeet tin 1 deficit of the post officedepartment has raised a hornetsnest, brought about an exhaustive discussion of the workings ofthe department and aroused a demand for a thorough investigationof its methods, including therates paid the railroads, thefranking system, the rent paidlor mail ears, ami the feasibilityof a parcels post system.It is difficult to understandwhy in Canada, a country as wideas the l 11 it eel States and far lessdensely popidated, the government. made such a large profit inhandling second class matter at ahalf a cent a pound that the ratewas reduced to a quarter cent apound, while our department hasbeen losing $8,000,000 a year. Itis equally hard to comprehendhow the express companies canhandle packages at less rates thanthe post office department andstill be able to declare dividendsrunning as high as 300 per cent.Neither can the average citizenunderstand why the post officedepartment should pay for rentof mail coaches each year, the fullcost of building those coaches.It is even more difficult tocomprehend why an 11poundpackage can he sent by mail fromNew York to Japan for 12 centsa pound, while a four pound package sent from New York to Albany would require 16 cents apound postage, or how the German postal service can make asuccess of handling all sorts ofparcels up to a 100pound trunkat onethird of a cent a pound.John Brisben Walker discussesseveral of these questions in ananalysis of postal conditions prepared for the American Newspaper Publishers’ Association, inwhich he says in partThe average express haul today is less than thirtyeight miles.This is because trade is largelycarried on with those living nearby.If the government carried parcels at even one cent a pound itwould get the hundreds of millions of packages sent out by thegreat, drygoods houses. Thiswould probably reduce the average haul’ to twenty miles or less.The United States Government is already equipped withmore than 60,000 completely organized stations. These have theirmanagers and clerks, their rentals. heat, and light, their detective and legal services alreadypaid for. To handle parcelswould cost nothing additional intens of thousands of post officesexcept the wagon haul in the locality. . .putting all into one class and accepting packages up to 200pounds weight.The government is spendingmore than $32,000,000 annuallyon a country delivery service,which the Postmaster General reports as carrying only 25 poundsper trip per wagon. Each of thesewagons could carry from 500 to700 pounds per daily trip eachway. At one cent a pound this sorv ce instead of being conductedat an almost total loss, as now,would he clearing tens of millions. The wagon that now carries only 25 pounds, loaded eachway with 500 more pounds at arent a pound, would bring in a day additional.I am firmly of the opinionthat eventually the Governmentwill realize that the rate chargedin third of a centa pound—will be found sufficient.But for the present 1 would urgethe passage of a law making onecent a pound the rate for all merj j. j.

StudentsAbout 350 million years ago Michigan lay under a great inland sea, inwhose salty waters lived billions oftiny creatures. As they died, theirshells and skeletons sank to thebottom, and later were covered byearth.Today the sea ia gone, and themarine deposits have become compact layers which we know as limestone. An important resource initaelf, this limestone ia also a protective covering for other underground treasure, says Dr. WillardH. Parsons of Wayne Universitysgeology department in DetroitLimestone formations stretch below the surface of every county inMichigan, he points out In thLower Peninsula tha formations arshaped like a stack of shallow howls,with the deepest portions at thcenter of the atate.In thia deepburied portion, Michigans oil and gaa deposits ar* found.Sealed far beneath th* surface andheld in th* porous limestone layers,the oil pools and gas pockets remainuntil tapped, as in Isabella, Midland,Gladwin, and Barry Count. Thelimestone deposits in these interiorareas are thus more important asealed pouches for natural treasuresthan aa quarry sites.It is M th* bowls\\' edges in thelakebordered counties — ,Wayne, Huron, Arenac, Alpena,Presque Isle, Cheboygan, Emmet,and Charlevoi* • that limestonequarrying itaelf ia most profitableHera the limeetone ia close to thsurface, and near cheap water transportation.In tha Upper Peninsula, as in theLower, quarry sites have beenchosen near water transport, withMackinsc and Schoolcraft Countiesnoteworthy centers. Outcroppingoccur in many Upper Peninsulaspots, however, forming some of thescenic wonders of th* tree, like theBurnt Bluffs near Fayette.Aware of limestones importance.600 Wayne University students willmake field trip* to various quarrieswithin th* state this year. Theywill be studying Michigans gW white wealth of stone—basic ingredient in thmaking of iron, fe rtlliters, chemicals, and building mteriala: and • foundation stoneof Michigans prosperity.DIXIELAND JAZZ GETSNATIONS EAR AGAINNEW YORK.All over the nation. Dixieland Jazz is hot again,is the disclosure of Joseph Roddyin the June fl issue of Look Magazine. The great new temples,such as Birdland and Bop City,dedicated to the new jazz, arelosing their congregations, hefinds.As a native American art form,Dixieland is a lot of things to alot of people.” it is explained. Tothe jazz purist, his definitionstates, it is a ritually stylizedway of playing a hallowed set ofhollers, work songs, spirituals,blues and marches.\" Most of themexisted before 1920. Their idiological point of origin is New Orleans. he says.Record companies are reissuingsome of the best work* of oldDixieland greats, many of themNegroes. What caused the revivalof Dixieland jazz is a mystery.Roddy credits disk jockeys in various cities with helping the revival.Killed on AssignmentALBERT HINTON, one of the four war correspondents believed to have bcen occupants in a C47 militarytransport plane with 26 persons aboard that plungedinto the sea last Thursday about 10 miles south ofOshima Island, is cited as one of the most capable ofNegro journalists.Hinton was managing editor of the Norfolk Journaland Guide newspaper which is published in Norfolk,Ya., site of the worlds largest harbor. The Guide” isgenerally referred to by newsmen as the best edited ofrace sheets.” Hinton, while doing some outstandingreporting, is not wellknown as perhaps some other newswriters whose experiences have not been as broad. Thisis probably due to his quiet, un assuming nature a traitwhich has proved a valuable asset towards news gathering.Among his prominent assignments were coverageof the Columbia. Tennessee riots and the expose of thegrossly unequal and primitive” school system for Negroes in the county adjoining Norfolk.THE MANAGING EDITOR used to verenelv stophis work which was directed on two or three piles ofnews copy” to give me tips on the how or why ofcertain ways of handling the news. During one of thesedisturbances” he evidentally thought he needed a breakand started revealing some of his experiences at theColumbia, Tenn. riots trial.Deftlyskilled at use of adjectives. Hinton told ofthe meting of two newspapermen, members of separatebig, race weeklies, in Atlanta. Ga. .Upon hearing thathe was heading to cover the Columbia riots, both in anuncomfortably manner stated that they were just sodisappointed” that they had other assignments not tobe able to accompany him.U was that hot, too,” Hinton stated. The atmosphere was so loaded, particularly after the obscenewoid, N r, was used frequently by the prosecuting attorney and the judge, that I and another race correspondent grabbed a hired car after the trial and headedfor freedom’ which was in the next county about 15miles away.HINTON FOR HIS EXPOSE of the unsanitary andfu and equipped school system wonthe Wendell Willkie award for public service for theGuide.” These are just two of a long list of assignments that he could do brilliantly.No doubt that his death was as he would have itresulting while on assignment for the Guide and theNational Negro Press Association to report the news.Ravens onVacationNEW YORK. — The Ravens,Americas premier novelty andharmony quartette, are enjoyinga well earned vacation after anuninterrupted stretch of elevenstraight months of unceasing activity in theatres, nite clubs anddance halls from coast to coast.Leader Jimmy Ricks gave theboys the welcome news of a longhiatus following the completionof their engagement in the Picadilly Club in nearby Newark.The singers will resume activity with a long rehearsal siege,durng which time they will wadethrough a mountain of submittedmaterial to pick items for theirinitial fall recording sessions.lHClul) Girlat White HouseCharlotte Ingram, outstanding4H club girl of Ellendale, Del.joined with 4Her Mary AnnLong of hSelby.

ThereIs so much trouble and want inthe world,” they remark, butwhat can 1 do?What can you do? More perhaps than >ou think—even without money or worldly power orpolitical influence. AJi can helpby means of scientific prayer, thekind of prayer given to the worldnearly two thousand year* agoby Christ Jesus.He had no fortune to distributeto the needy, no endowed institutions to call upon for assistance, no worldly prestige. Yet hehealed the sick, fed the hungry,met the demands of the tax collectors, even raised the dead all through understanding, scientific prayer. . . .When the centurion at Capernaum asked the Master to healhis servant, he pleaded iMatthew8H>, Speak the word only, andmy servant shall be healed.Jesus commended his faith andsaid, Go thy way; and as thoubast believed, so be it done untothee.\" The narrative continues,His servant was healed in theselfsame hour.There was no need to journeyto the bedside of the sick man.No need for Jesus to take onefootstep in any direction. He didnot send medical supplies or foodor money. He applied the truth heknew of God and man. He understood the nature of man made inthe image and likeness of God.And he said (John 1412), Hethat believeth on me, the worksthat I do shall he do also.Mary Baker Eddy, the Discoverer and Founder of ChristianScience, writes in Science andHealth with Key to the Scriptures* (p. 494)way« haa met and always willmeet every human need. It Is notwell to imagine that Jesus demonstrated the divine power toheal only for a select numberor for a limited period of time,since to all mankind and in everyhour, divine Love supplies allgood.The writer has had ample evidence of the farreaching effectof Christian Science. Even during her school days she w as manytimes protected, healed, andguided by the prayers, the spiritual understanding, of a ChristianScientist living three thousandmiles away, in another country.Neither time nor space can interfere with the operation of Godslaw. ...The understanding that God,divine Spirit, Infinite good, is Alland that man is His reflection,hence spiritual and perfect, accomplishes such healings. Rightthinking from the basis of thistruth of God and man benefits all.Such prayer, based on spiritualunderstanding, welling from aheart cleansed of pride and selfseeking, blesses the world.Such prayer does not prohibitor prevent the giving of rightmaterial aid to others or justifyus in turning aside from anypractical way in which we mayminister to the needy. On thecontrary, the deeds we do shouldillustrate the truth we know.But nothing can measure the spiritual power for good of selfless,silent right thinking.'"
