When night came on it began to b ow a gale and the privateer parted from the schooner the captain previously giving orders to the prize master not to permit captain Johnson to be en deck in the night , lest he should retake his ves sel .

Account ofa dead body found under the porch of Christ Church , in Boston , Massachu setts , in a high state of preservation . A circumstance occurred a short time since , while the workmen were repaying Christ Church in this town , and erecting some new tombs under it . that deserves to be recorded in the Anthology . 1 he ground under the porch at the entrance of the Church was directed to he dug up , this spot having been given stir the erection of two tombs . At the distance of six feet from the surface , a grave was discovered , in which was found a coffin of hard pitch pine , jomtnonly called the Norway pine , ve ry little decayed , which , on being opened , contained another of the same wood , very handsomely made , and not at all injured the lid of this being lifted showed a body wrapped in a tarred sheet , that , on being remitted from the fate , presented the couu . tenartde of a \\' man that appeared quite re cently to have died ; his flesh was fresh and florid , as though just shaved < the flesh hard to the touch , and every appearance of a new corpse , from a short and not painful illness two or three sprigs of myrtle or box , green as just cut front \\' the stock , were also lying on the outside of the tarred sheets . Both coffins had on their lids , in brass nails , the letters I . T . and a grave stone , at the hfcadof the grave , declared the person interred there to be Mr . John - Thomas , of the Island of Barha does , aged 45 years , who died 25th June ; A . Dv 1726 , more than eighty txvo years ago . The number of persons who came to see this curious fact , from the fineness of the preservation , and the manner of it , induced the wardens to direct the coffin to be closed , again and buried , which it is , at the N . E . corner of , he church . The soil under the porch was a yellow clay , mixed witli small stones and some gravel . Whether the body had been ( DOMESTIC . Tlie following extract from the Winy aw . Intelligencer , printed at Georgetown , in South Carolina , will show the extraordinary degre of ex citement which still prevails in that State , on the subject oftlie Tariff . It is not pleasant to recur to tl esc things , hut it is in vain to shut the eye eye upon them . — JWitrlnt . The Richmond Whig says , Vir ginia is brought to the alternative which i e long ago predicted either to secede fiom the Union , or to ac quiesce in the Tariff . So far we agree with the above , that we have long believed no real change of the tarifl \\' would take place that those who tax us for their own benefit are and will continue to be a majority , & that we must act decided ly , be the consequence what it may , or acquiesce ” in infractions of our liberties and interests , . to which the oretically and practically the causes of I the revolution were trifling . But the necessity of seceding is doubted . If South Carolina , w ith her inoral force , her unblemished repu tation , should take decided measures , we believe the interests of a portion of those who live upon us—the ship owners for , drive them into open hostility to the present system . They well know that a sep aration of the Union would be a blow to the Northern Atlantic . sea board , and of course a great injury to tbe interior . But to those who , when — not tri fling , not speculative , but important , practical lights are taken from us , even the most important of all , - s lf government—to those who in sucit times shrink Iroin acting , and entrench themselves behind arguments and sen timents which have been in all ages the apology for submission and servi tude ; we would recommend to them as a master the beloved Ferdinand , or , better \\' yet , the amiable Don Mi gucl .

Abdication of the King . Monday , August 2 Commission ers were sent to Rambouillet to treat with the King , and alter some nego tiation he consented to abdicate , and the commissioners agreed that he should receive a liberal allowance for the support of himself and his family . The following is the official act of ab dication . It was superscribed To my cousin the Duke of Orleans , Lieu tenant General of the Kingdom “ Rambouillet August , 2 , 1830 . My cousin , I am toa profoundly grieved by the evils which afilict or might threaten my people , not to have sought a means of preventing them . I have therefore taken the rc 5 Iution to abdicate the Crqvrh in fa vor of my grandson the Duke de Bor deaux . A Tile Dauphin who partakes my sentiments , also ren twees his rights in favor of his nephew . You will have then in your quality of Lieutennnt Gehcral of the Kingdom to cause the Accession of Henry V . to the Crown to be proclaimed . You will take besides all ( lie measures which concern you to regulate the lerms of the Government during the minorijy of the new King . Here I confine myself to making known these dispositions ; it is a means to avoid rna . ny evils . You will communicate my inten tion to the Diplomatic Body , and you will acquaint me as soon as possihle > with the proclamation by which my grandson shall have been recognised King of France , under the name of Henry V . I charge Lieutenant General Vis count do Foissac Latour to deliver this letter to you . lie has orders to settle with you the arrangements to he made in favor of the persons who have accompanied nic , as well as the ar rangements necessary for what con cerns me , and the rest of my family . We will afterwards regulate the other measures which will be the con sequence of the change of the reign . 1 repeat to you , my cousin , the assurances of the sentiments with which I am your affectionate cousin , CHARLES .

And the King , beholding one mightier than him self in Italy , called Mussolini to his side . It was the King for Musso lini or Mussolini himself might have been crowned King by his soldier followers . In eight years Mussolini has made Italy over . He has broken up cum bersome and idle estates into pro ductive . moll farms , reclaimed mil lions of acres cL waste lands , har nessed the waters of the mountains , built highways all over Italy , put ships unpon the seven seas and filled the air with Lying machines . Make no mistake about this Mussolini ; he is the most dynamic personality on earth to day . Beggars and street walkers are nowhere apparent in Italy to day . He has made Italians conscious of their illustrious an cestry . Much cf the glory of an cient Rome was buried under its hills and sidewalks . Mussolini has unearthed it and is making Rome mere wonderful every day . He will make it the playground of the civil ized world . FARM NOTES MAY FEED COWS AT LOWER COST Crushed wheat and barley is cheaper than corn meal as a feed for dairy cattle and is just as effi cient in producing milk when fed pound for pound as a substitute .

ANDREW ROUNSAVEbt , jailor , dec 30 The past year has been remarkable for deaths among eminent men in this country . Years have been trequently noticed , which have proved very iatal to this description ol j persons , and on that account have attracted attention . The year 1789 was one of those epochs , when a peculiar mortality prevailed among distinguished characters . 1559 was still more remarkable , including a small portion ot the preceding and subsequent years , being less than 15 months , there died , a pope , an emperor , two kings of France , king of England , a king of Portugal , a king of Denmark , a queen dowager of Poland , queen of England , queen Mary of Hungary , queen Eleanor , the doge and patiiarch ot Venice , thedukeof Ferrara , 13 cardinals , and several other persons of great distinc tion . Sickness has prevailed throughout the U . S . in a greater degree for the last year than it has probably for 20 years before consequently its victims in the higher class es of society n ust have been great as the mortality w as extended . We notice and feel the death of a great man more than one in common circumstances , as during his life he has occupied more of the public attention and regard . R hen a light in town is extin guished , its loss i « soon and extensively per ceived , and doubly felt too , if we have been accustomed to look olten towards it , or to depend upon its beams , for pleasure or uti lity . Certain it is , ” saitb my Lord Coke , “ that when a great learned man ( w ho is long in making ) dieth , much learning dieth with him . Pallida mors aequo pulsat pedepauperum tabernas Regumque lurres , O hea te st xte , Vitae summa brevis spern nos vetat in choare longam . Death forgets none , in bis relentless march The great , the good , the humble feel alike His iutbless pow er . And the short sum of life Still checks our freest and most ardent hopes . Portland Gaz . FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT AT RICHMOND . Richmond , January c 2 8 , 1820 . The business of the Legislature has daily jacrea ed in interest for the last fortnight . Resolutions of a most violent character , on the subject of Missouri , have passed the House of Delegates , been very much modi fied and in.proved in the Senate , and are now sent back to the House for concurrence . They excited very little discussion in either body . They unlortunately involved a ques tion , too deeply affecting particular interests , to admit ol much diversity of opinion , except amongst persons inhabiting different sections cf the Union . In the House of Delegates , an incidental question was raised on the sub ject of the right of instructions , and was de cided without much discussion , and by a very large majority , in favor ot the authority which the Legislature have chosen to usurp , in violation of the rights , no less of the peo ple themselves , than of the general govern ment . A bill for repealing , rather for materially altering the usury laws of the state , was yes terday discussed and rejected in the House of Delegates . The stay law was to day on the carpet , and ( as my Loid Coke says ) will most probably “ be bandied to and fro ” for several days to come . Its fate is less certain than formerly ; but I still think it will be rejected . question has excited more interest in either house , than that relating to the remo val ol Piince YV illiam Court House . In the House of Delegates it was decided , after a very warm contest , by an almost unanimous vote in favor of removal ; and in the Senate , the same result was obtained in a vote of 16 to 5 , alter a discussion occupying the great er part of two days . A bill has passed , authorising the Board of Public Works to subscribe ( l think , ) 25,00U dollars to the road leading from the Falls bridge to the Leesburg road . Is Alex andria asleep on this subject ? or will she avail berseH of a law which Las passed the House ot Delegates , and wiil certainly pass the Senate , lor uniting the Leesburg and Little Riv r Turnpike roads ? The bill respecting toe officers cf incorpo rated companies , residing in th * district , lias been recommitted , and , of course , is yet to be acted on - What its fate will be , 1 cannot tell ; my own impression is , that it will pass the house , and be rejected in th * Senate . ( The Little River turnpike company have failed in their application for permission to stop up their sideways . It was reported un reasonable by the committee , and rejected at once in the house . Defalcation is the order of the day here . The state loss ! > j Y the I reasurer is estimated at upwards of 100,000 dollars . And a teller in the office ol Discount and Deposit is found wanting in the sum of 60,000 dollars . The petty transactions in Lynchburg and Peters - j burg , arc hardly worth noticing after those . !

Among the many orators who have dis played their eloquence at the bar , both io America and in Europe , none have been more successful in touching the finest feel ings of the heart , an - exciting tke noblest passions ot the soul , than Mr .

Hiseulogiurn on the jin mortal Washington , is ot itself a master piece of eloquence , in his character ot Be naparte , he paints the actions ot that wofl derfui personage in language at once sub lime and imposing : with all the chasttnelft and precision of an historian , he recapitu lates bis movements from the cradle to th camp—trom the camp to the lastly from the elevated station of an em peror to that of an exile and iug can be supplied with hand railing , cut to by confirming a truth , that power unsupport xny dimensions , at a short notice . e d by virtue is liable to wither and decay . His speeches on the various Crim .

His speeches on the Emancipation of the Roman Catholics oi Ireland , need no om ment—they speak for themselves—and un fold to mankind the history of a ( ) a s of men , vvho , although denied many political and ci vil privileges , have always been known to be the friends of th < ir country in times of danger and in . — r ] he .

Patriot . THE Declaration of Independence , XTEliave no authentic copy of this most VV important state paper , the very basis that supports the proud column of American liberty ; none , at least , on which the eye of taste can res I , for a moment , with satisfac tion , Why have we not ? The English nation , still proud of their MAGNA CHARTA , though every provi sion it contains has been trampled upon by the bold ambition of their rulers , have pub lisbed edition after edition of this instrument , each more splendid than its predecessor . Sir Wiiliam Blackstono has collated and commented on it—his fine copy of Magna Charta has been excelled by later specimens of art , and the fac similes of the seals and signatur e.diave made every reader of taste in Great Britain acquainted , in some de gree , not merely with the state ofknowledge and of art at the period in question , but with the literary attainments , al > , of King John , King Henry , and fbeir “ Barons bold . Surely the Declaration of American Inde pendence is , at least , as well entitled to the decorations of art as the Magna . Charta ol England ; and it the fac similes of the sig natures of the patriots who signed it were published in America , it would serve to gra tify a curiosity , at least as laudable as that which calls for imitations of the correspon dents of Junius or of the aristocracy that wrested the English Charter from the reluc tant monarchs of the day . We are firmly persuaded that the more the principles ol our Declaration of Indepen dence are spread out before the eyes of the world , the more they will be admired , by foreign nations as well as our own : and eve ry innocent and hone t device that may serve to attract attention toward them , wi also , to promote the great cause of public li berty . Such an embellishededition as will render it an ornament to an apartment , will have a tendency to spread the knowledge of its contents , among those who would other wise have turned their thoughts but ligl Jy subject . Such an edition will towards the serve to place it continually under the eye of man , woman , and child in a will associate the pleasurable ideas of ele gance and ornament with the history of the transaction itsell—and familiarize those principles which form , or ought to form , the very bond and cement of political society . Nor is it of small moment that such an edt tion , well executed , will serve as a specimen of the state ot the Fine Arts amongst us at the present day . Actuated by these views , the subscriber proposes to publish A SPLENDID EDITION OF THE Declaration of Independence , Which shall be , in all respects , Ameri can . All the necessary materials shall be manufactured in this country , and express ly tor this publication . The designs , the engravings shall be the work of American Artists ; the publication throughout shall af ford evidence ot what our citizens have done in politics and condo in art . From the arrangements made , and the dispositions manifested by the artists , it is confidently expected that this engraving will be , when finished , a splendid and truly na tional publication The Publisher thinks be can premise that it shall be ready to deliver o Subscribers in February next , at TEN dollars each copy , to be paid on delivery . The engravings will be accompanied by a oamphlet , containing the official documents connected with the publication as authori ties , a id a list of the Subscribers ’ Names . It is contemplated to have a few copies printed on paper prepared to carry colors , to have the shields accurately tinctured in the modern style ; and the plants , c - color ed by one of our most approved water co lorers . The price ot those superb copies will be THIRTEEN dollars each . As no more of those copies will be printed than ball be subscribed for , gentlemen who wish for them , are requested to add the word “ colored ” to their subscription . JOHN BINNS , Chesnut street , Philadelphia . dec30 dtf From the AMERICAN MERCURY . The APOLOGIZER No . II . A S my enquiries arc extended into the nature of anti federalifm , and of the motives which acftuate fuch people , I become more convinced , that my deflgn of a general apology for them is very meritorious , and ought to have been made long ago ; and I cannot conceive the reafon why it hath never been publicly attempted , unlefs it be the excreme difficulty of an inveftigation . In all other political fubje s a writer may deduce his ar guments and leading principles , from public utili ty , and from a number of moral maxims , which the couitefy of the world hath for many ages al lowed to be facred ; but on attempting I find thefe fources fail me ; to fupply the want , I mull have recourfe , in my own meditations , to the fituation , abilities , particular interefls , and paflions of cer tain characters ; this method of actual experi ment , I conceive to be a fure way of coming to the truth , but the progrefs is flow , and the public patience may be exhaufled before the completion of this undertaking . The lafl anti federal fubjetft , which I have had under infpeetion , furnifhed me fome curious in formation in what philofophers have called , the fcale of being , or a feries of exigencies with in cheating fenfe and reafon , from an oylter up to thofe genii of the air , which can play with moun tains and hurricanes as a child doth with a rattle box . To my great fuprize I found this gentle man , under a natural neceffity , of being anti federal or difhoneit , and I can now allure my rea ders upon the llrength of this experiment , that the popular opinion of at leaft a linall degree of roguery , being at the bottom of anti federalifm , is not true in all cafes , for I have found one hoiiell man in this clafs of people , and whenever 1 find another , notice fhall be given of the difeovery . In this examination nothing appeared different from what is found in other men , except a A range limitation of all the feeing and judging faculties within very narrow dimenfions . The mind aCted and judged vigoroufly on linall objects , but was utterly incapable of extending its views to the policy of a nation , or the benefit of fo great a number of people as inhabit the Unitec ? States ; neither could he conceive any kinc of advantage from a communication between pco pie fo diflant in fituation . He feared much the fame confequences from the union , as might hap pen from building a bridge to the moon , which would only ferve as a pafs way for lunatics anc other dangerous enemies . After attempting whole day to enlarge his underflanding , I fount my work in vain , and that no man can fee fur ther than nature ha « enabled him . From this have taken the hint to form a fcale of minds , which I have thrown into four grand divifious , viz . Parifh intellects , County intellects , State intellects , and Federal intellects . The fub divjfions in each of thefe clafies , mud be formed from future experiments , and when the fcale is compleated , I think it will be an infalli ble guide ro all honed electors . I would humbly propole to the refpectable pub lic , that when the fcale is completed , the party terms of whig and tory , federal and anti federal , republican and democrat , Ihould be thrown a fide , and every man s political opinions be def cribed by the fcale of his intellects . Names of men s invention caufe much offence in the world but I think no man can be offended , when we de feribe him by the dandard of nature itfelf . Where there is no reafon for blame there ought not to be any odium . Nature has made monkies , men and angels—dill we know that a monkey is not a man , nor a man an angel—each of thefe grades are made to fee , move and be happy in the communion of their own order ; and fhould we deferibe to a monkey the community of an gels , with their conditution and laws , Pug would very honeftly be anti federal , and declare off from the union . O N the 12th of February , at fcven in the even ing , a tremendous fire broke out at Point Petre , in Guadaloupe , and was not extinguished till midnight . There were twenty five capital buildings confumed , befides a number of fnrjler ones—the whole lofs ellimared at fix millions of livres . We are happy 10 add , that a number of veflels belongingto the United States were ly ing in the harbor , the mailers and crews of which exerted themfelves in the moll fignal manner on this difti effing occafion ; and the affiflance they lent was e ltecmcd fo important as to entitle them to receive the thanks of the public by a committee from the citizens of the town , as follows By aCommittee of the Citizens of Point a Petre , to the Americans now amongfl us Brave and generous Friends and Allies , THE unfortunate perfons who have fuffcred by the late mercilefs fire in this town , feel them felves under the moll lafling obligations to you , for your fo generoully expoling your owfi lives in endeavouring to lave their efFecfts and property from ruin . Such as have efcaped the rage of this devour ing element , are no lefs indebted to you for their lives—your prefence of inind , llrength and refolu tion in arrelting its fatal progrefs , lay claim to a lalling remembrance from every inhabitant of this place . This unfortunate accident was notneceflary to prove , that all mankind are brethren ; much lefs , to convince the French of your lincere attach ment to them . It is the wifh of the committee that the addrefs may , in the moll public manner tcllify their grate ful acknowledgments for your fervices on this melancholy occafion ; and that a copy of the ad drefs may fo far meric your approbation , as to be lent to the ininiiler of France , that it may be forwarded and prefented to the reprefentatives of the United States of may a people fo illullrious andfo generous as the Ame ricans , enjoy all the profperity and happinefs of which they are fo highly deferving .

S THE TABLET . No . CXI . V Not for himfelf he fees , or hears , or eats “ Artifts mull chiffe his piftures , mufic , meats . T HE tafte of the world is regulated by very few per Ions . This may feem the more ftrange , as few people approve ot the fafhions they are compelled to follow . It is not eafy to account for it , that in a land of freedom where men are left ^ in 1110ft refpedts , to purfue what their inclination dictates , fo many perfons fhould lead a life totally the reverfe ot what they with . Amanfeems , as it were , to give up his natural in dependence of temper , the moment he begins to live in fathion . He never can confult liiscoveni ence , and not often the particular call ot his fan cy , in the choice of his food or apparel . The pri vilege of chofing for one s felf is furrendered by every one , who would be fuppofed tafhionable . A man of finifhed tafte mult feldom eat what he likes , or wear what is convenient for him . As no great harm refults from this kind of felf denial , in a general way , it is not my intention to com plain of it . There is however fome regard to be paid to reafon and nature , in the regulation of our drefs . Though tafte cannot be managed by any rules which admit of demonftration , there is neverthelefs , in fome things , a natural propriety which ought not to be overlooked . For inftance , drefs Ihould be accommodated to the feafon and climate . The laws offafhion can never control the conftitution of our bodies in fuch a manner , that the people of a cold climate can , without real impropriety , borrow their modes of drefs , from the inhabitants of a warmer one . French fafhions may be , in themfelves , fuperior to thole of any other nation , but they illy apply to thelituation of the Northern parts of the Uni ted Srates . The furrs of Ruffia are much better adapted to our winters , than the filks of France . It is not a matter of confequence in point of ex pence , what country we imitate in our drefs , be caufe if we arc induftrious , we can afford to wear what we pleafe . But when we conlider how the health is affected , it becomes an affair of ferious moment , to whom we look for direction in form ing our tafte . It would difeover more real good feitfe to form our own—but as this would be trou blefonie , I do not expetft we fhall ever be fo inde pendent . Foreigners remark that the ladies of America lofe their bloom , and impair their viva city at a very early period of life . I am of the opinion that the irregularity of our climate is the principal caufe of this unfortunate fadl . Perhaps this is a misfortune againft whi li there is no per fect remedy . The effedtsof it , however , maybe partly counteracted , and our women may preferve their health and vivacity much longer than they do . There is no doubt , thata warmer drefs in the Winter , than is ufually worn by our females , would meliorate their Conftitution , and contribute to their happinefs . Thefe few hjnts , I hope will be enlarged upon , by foineperfon of leifure and re flection . NEW YORK , SATURDAY , MAY 29 . The Ship Harmony Capt . IVillet is arrived at Philadelphia from Bengal .

PROGRESS OK THE BRABANT REVOLUTION . By a letter from Brufl els of the 14th of Febru ary , it appears tha : a mifundej Handing prevails among the leaders of the revolutiomlls . The Duke d Urfel , prelident of the war department , had religned , alligning his bad Hate ot health as a realon—A writing was handed about , fctting forth other reafons for his retiring , particularly that he did notchooleto ferve with Baron Schon feld , a pruilian general , who had been taken in to pay by Congrels , with the rank of lieut . gene ral , and to command the foreign troops in theii fervice ; which meafure he conceived contrary to the intereft of his country , and countenanced by a Congrefs fublervient to the committee of Breda , The Duke contra • fed this writing , but in tei ms which ( till impli e add ! , is faction with public ineafures . At the iiuerct.uon of the five compa nies of Bruliel - volume * - he has refumed liis poll . To remove liVVi ruft , he has been in formed of the grand 1 lecret , till that time un known , of connections formed with foreign courts—thefe connections are not generally ap proved of , and it would appear that Mr . Van der Noot s intereft is on the decline . The adherents of the revolution are divided into parties , which are differing more apd more from each o ( her—the one party conlifts of thofe who with to fupport what is called the prefent con futation j that is to fay the arrangements by which the Affembly of the three Eftateshavc tak en polleflion of the fovereiguty , without the con fetti of the people , which conftitution tends to an oligarchy of the worft kind , a clerical oligarchy . In order to fupport this fyftem , the dates of Bra bant refolved to adininifter an oath of fidelity to the corps called fermens , foine of that body took it whilft the greater part 1 efufed , requefting that it fliould be printed , to fee whether it was con formable to the intereft of the country . This refufal created great debates in the dates .

The divifions and animofities run very high . The Three Edates of Brabant have opened afub feription for the fupport of their troops , under the direction of the clergy , together with theuia gidrates of the different cities .

That certain refolutions were read at a fecond meeting pallid at a former , which wet e confirmed and fent by an exprefs to the Emperor .

Confequent y the ufe of the German language which the Hungarians oppofed fo much , will no longer be neceilary in the tribunals and public adts , and Latin will again be refumed . The crown will be reftored to thecuftody of the nation , and the coronation is to take place as foon as pollible . What is of ftill greater importance , the regifter for taxing lands , according co the new fyftem which theFmperor wiilyed to introduce through out his ftates , is abfolutely given up with refpedt to Hungary . The foregoing accounts are confirmed by a let ter from Vienna , of the 29th of January , wbicj , But how is it to day ? The party in Baltimore drop the darling name of “ whig ” and send out a general address to their friends in the whole Union as “ Democrats . ” The term Democrat , which they have always ridiculed , and abused because it i 3 every where claimed by Mr . Van Buren s and Gen . Jackson s friends ; this heretofore odious name of the friends of popular rights , those candid federal whigs now take up and claim as their own . What will the people think of such miserable trickery ; such cool unblushing deceit ? Do the federalists expect to mislead one tree genuine , Democratic Republican vot r , hy su , , shallow artifices ? But our adversaries have a . ways treat * d , the great masses of the free vot\"r 3 of the country , as beng ignorfnt and unlettfred enough to beguiled by any flimsy deception , they might desire to practice upon them .

Meeting In Gates A meeting of a respectable portion of the Democratic Republican citizens of Gates county , was held in the Court House at Gatesville , on the 18th of May , 1840 .

Richard McIntosh . The committee after retiring for a few mo ments , returned and reported through their Chairman , R . Rawles , the following pream ble and resolutions , which were unanimous ly adopted . Whereas , a Presidential election is fast approaching , and the party opposed to the present administration of our General Gov ernment , are making efforts to induce the free aud independent people of North Caro lina to vote for a man for the office of Presi dent , whose political opinions this meeting consider at variance with every principle of Republican doctrine Therefore , Resolved , that we cannot give our support to William H . Harrison , in the approaching contest , because we consider him inadequate to the discharge of the duties ot President of this great Republic , because we believe his nomination was the result of abolitionism , because we believe him oppos ed to the interest of a large portion of the Union , and more particularly the South , be cause we believe him to be in favor of a high protective Tariff , in favor of a national Bank , and against a Sub treasury ; and lastly for voting to expose to public sale , the poor white men of the country to satisfy Court costs and charges contrary to the Constitution of the United States . Resolved , That we do not believe Martin Van Buren infallible , yet we believe the general tendency of his administration is well calculated to promote the good and happiness of this fiee country : therefore , we are deter mined to give him our cordial support for re clection .

All indus trious democrats have got through with their com and hilled all up , except perhaps , here and there , a piece of stumpy new ground by the 18th of July . Well , have your horses held in the grass , and then mount them and ride around to see how your neigh bors and acquaintances , stand as to the elections . You have a hard struggle before you . The rich men , backed by ihe Bank influenc , are flooding the country with lying pamphlets and papers in all directions . They are holding their great Log Cabin Hard Cider meetings all over the Union , with banners , and shouts , and huzzahs , to alarm you and brow b at you . Remember , they have always clapped their wings and crowed loud , before an election as they do now . They cannot believe it possible that , what they call ignorant country peo ple , ehould be able to out number them at the polls But you will teach them in August next , that you are not to be f ightened by th < ir clamor ; you will spare a little time , to spread information in your neighborhoods , and counteract their false charges . See to it . See to it . See to it , f.iends of human libeitv . Be up and doing , for the good cause of your rights . Do not sleep on your posts . See that every inan goes to the polls , and swells with his vote the overwhelming majority for your republican friend General Saunders . Be in in time , and look ahead to the flection day in August , make your arrangements delihcr ately , and be ready to teach your adversaries , when the day shall come , that your name is legion , in old North Carolina . One honest i ruzgle , and all will be safe . Conquer . Conquer at all hazards , in Au gust , for Governor , and the Legislature , and your victory will be the easier in November . Nail your colors to the mast and never give up the ship . It in needless to say that this is the way the federalists will do ; they always have done so their voters never fail to be at the polls , whilst the democrats are very often too thronged with work to go to the election . Bear it in mind , That the democrats never have lost the con test when they ALL turned out to the elec tion . Dont forget this . Some men station themselves at the ballot box on the day of election , to brow beat and over awe the poor men , who may happen to be IN DEBT to them . Democrats will you suffer this thing to be done ? No , you must never tamely bend to the tyrant oppressor s yoke ! you must be permitted to vote precisely as you wish , * Unawetl by influence and tin bribed by gain . Stand at the Polls Until the ballot box is closed , and see that the infirm democrats nre not kept away from voting by the crowd . Men are employed in some places to block up the polls and keep the democrats away . AA atch well that the way is kept clear . DEMOCRATS , ORGANIZE ! ! ! DEMOCRATS of the OLD NORTH STATE VA c put a SOLEMN Question to you ARE YOU PREPARED FOR THE BATTLE ? It comesoff ” in a very few weeks and you have but little time left for preparatory organ ization . The time most be usefully employed . Every District , County , anil precinct should have its Committee to class the voters , and bring out every democrat to the polls . Let this not be neglected , as it is all important that EY ERY MAN should be brought to the polls . Be Careful To examine well and see that the ballot box is empty when the voting commences . By no means suffer yourselves to neglect this . There is more in it than strikes the eye at first sight . The most outrageous frauds will undoubtedly be committed upon the ballot boxes by the federalists this year . Take warn ing by your late August election . You know that squads of federalists would march from one precinct to another , and vote at every one . Again we caution and entreat you to see to this thing at each place of voting . Count the Votes as soon as the polls are closed . Insist that this be done , and with open doors in every instance . Remember , freemen , that the bal lot box is your only hope . It is there where your liberties will be preserved or lost . If you suffer fraud to creep iuto the bollot box at this trying crisis in our history , when the money of the country is arrayed in open re bellion against its laws , and in open warfare against the people , you will soon feel the chains of despotism clanking upon your limbs your boasted . liberties will soon take to Be at the Polls Democrats ; No matter whether it rains , hails or snows , be at the polls , and be there at least two hours before they are open . Talk to your friends—talk to the federalists—tell them the truth—conviction always goes hand in hand with truth . When the polls are open Vote yourself and then LOOK OUT FOR THE REST . Be at hand all day , and if there be a democrat missing , Start out after him . Possibly he may be backward with his seed ing and unable to lose the time required to g o to the place of voting . Send him along and work for him yourself , that is fair and honorable to Get out the voters . Fayetteville FEMALE SEMINARY .

More harm is probably done by the nse of arsenic in wall paper and in other articles , and by the indiscriminate employment of its compounds in kill ing insects , than by its intentional use as a poison . In England , when arsenic is sold in quantities of less than ten pounds , it is required by law to be col ored with one thirty pecond part of its weight of indigo , or one sixteenth of its weight of soot ; the object being to render any liquid to which the arsenic might be added with murderous intent of a black or bluish color , and thus in dicate the presence of something un usual . In Massachusetts and most other States , any apothecary or other person who sells arsenic without the written prescription of a physician must keep a record of the date of such sale , the amount sold , and the person or persons to whom delivered . Hap pily , the methods of detecting arsenic in animal substances are how so uner ring and trustworthy that it is hardly within the range of possibility that a person could come to his death by this poison without its being easily detected by a chemist the ; pro pom kd immigration BOARD . We publish in this issue a well written article by the editor of the Land Journal , touching U ou a scheme whicli we regard as being worthy of the thoughtful con sideration , not only of the pre s of this region but o f every individual who is either directly or indirectly interested in tbe prosperity and development of northern Dakota ? The author observss , and very sensibly too , that there are thousands scattered over tbe land who are dissatisfied with their surroundings and are contemplating a change . Now it is a generally known fact that Kansas , Nebras ka and Tsxas are constantly flooding the country with emmigration documents ; a means through which they successfully reach this class of inquirers , who naturally enough—having never heard of this rich country—are led to purchase and settle upon their lands . Official reports show that Kansas sold more land last season than either Dakota , Colorado , Texas or Nebraska . The cause is thus very reasonably attributed to the fact that it has done more advertising than any two of the states or terri tories mentioned , and not because it possesses any marked superiority over them . * Our correspondent also very truthfully remarks that tho boards of immigration of these various states are doing this advertising . A scheme which they have learned by experience , exerts a powerful influence in their favor . Hundreds of people who hare been induced to come to this county through the influence of the Alkkt and other journals is sufficient to convince any fair minded person that such influences are of great benefit to our county . “ A Chinaman consumes three and a half gallons of water a day , ” wrote Gen .

Camp at Lose Tree . I Bark op the Missouri River , > June 2d , 1880 . ) Life on the plains is not without its bright side as well as its rough . At this camp , in order to enjoy the benefits of a band—a great number of the members of camp being musically inclined—and hav ing some Gilmore genius ” in our midst , we invented a model bass viol , ” one of the most carious , perhaps , ever used . In order that you may have some idea of tLe manufacture , I shall explain its construc tion . An ordinary cracker box , with one side—in this case the top—taken out ; the neck and fingerboard extending through the box , two holes for the purpose being cut in top and bottom , joining at the same time the screw and tail piece . Four strings are made out of good strong chalk or fishing lines , a bridge , and the keys are inserted , you tune up , as on a good in strument , and you are in possession of as good a bass viol as you ever heard . The bow is made of a piece of hoop pole , and the same line used as strings on the instru ment can be made applicable in construct ing the bow . Our other instruments are violin , fife , mouth harmonica , a tin bucket , used as a drum , a piece of sheet iron used as a bass drum , a horse shoe used as a tri angle , and last , but not least , a brass horn or trumpet . The band discourses some fine airs , and at a short distance you would imagine that Pat Gilmore s full band—brass and string , were playing some of their finest pieces .

TERRITORY OF DAKOTA , Auditor s Office . Whereas , Tbe Springfield Fire and Marine Insurance Company located in the city ot Springfield , and State of Massa chusetts , has filed in this office a a sworn statement of its condition on the 31st day of December , A . D . , 1879 , in ac cordance with the provisions of an act of the Legislative Assembly of the Territory of Dakota , relating to insurance com panies , approved February 16th , 1877 Whereas , on examination of the sworn statement of said company filed in this office , I find that the said insurance com pany is possessed of the necessary amount of capital invested as required by law . Therefore I , E . A . Sherman , Auditor of Dakota Territory , do hereby certify that said Insurance company is duly authorized to transact the business of fire insurance in this territory , for the year ending Dec . 31st , 1880 , by agents properly appointed . S . K . McG nniss , Agent , Jamestown , Dakota . In testimony whereof , I have hereunto Set my Hand and Seal , this 14th day of Jan . , A . D . 1880 . E . A . SHERMAN . By L . M . Pcrdy , Deputy . Auditor . those : claims . There are over fifteen jumpable tree claims in Stutsman county , and fifty in dividuals ready to juinp ‘ em ” as soon as they are advised as to their location . It seems wrong to jump a man s claim but in many cases it is not wrong . A person either has a right , or has no right . If he has lived up to the letter of the law to the best of his ability the law will pro tect him . If be has not , the law does not recognize him at a claimant , and he has no right to ask it to . There are hun dreds of tree claims and homestead en tries made by persons who do not intend , and never did intend to improve them , to any great extent ; but simply hold them in any way they can until they advance to a desired figure , and then sell them out . This class of claimants and homesteaders are no better than any other class of gov ernment swindlers , and their Claim , when jumpable , ought to be jumped . This course is damaging to every law abiding citzens of the county , for the simple rea son that the land they hold is not culti vated to a profitable extent by any one , and in nine cases out of ten , is of no more value to the county than so many acres held by speculators of a different stripe . The government does not give their land to persons to speculate with but to cultivate , and unless they do so we can see no reason why they should not be jumped . Captive Humming Birds . In the time of the Montezumas , hum ming birds were tamed and kept in large conservatories . Doctor Zipperlero , of Cincinnati , tells of two humming birds which strayed in May , a year ago , into the house of a lady in that city and were captured The lady , a friend of birds , resolved to try the experiment of domesticating the little creatures , although she was aware that such attempts ended usually in the death of the birds . She had no suitable cage so she selected a large candy jar , and fixed a perch inside . In the bottom sbe placed a boquet of flow ers , and covered the open end with gauze . The flowers were renewed every day . The convolvulus , tropicolum , honeysuckle , and other flowers with a long calyx were selected . A little honey was dropped into every blossom . The birds began to sip the swe t food on the first day , humming above the flow er cups , darting their tongues in and out among them swift as lightning . They also snapped at little insects and devoured them . After some weeks they were given some honey ihinncd with water , in a small dish . They sat upon their low perch and lapped the honey with their tongues , like a dog drinking water . In a short time the birds were so tame that the gauze that confined them was removed , and ( hey flew about the room while their glass palace was cleaned and furnished with fresh flowers and honey but as soon as this operation was finished they flew into the glass again , and began eating the honey . If the lady took a nap alter dinner , they perched themselves upon her forehead , and enjoyed . their siesta thrre . They hummed about tbc room for hours , halting for rest upon the finger ot their friend , and dressing their feathers . For a change they would fly again to the honey , but after a moment ary taste away they would go , flying about their friend . Towards evening they sought their perch in their glass palace , and sang quick flute notes in the finest pianissimo . They occasionally snapped at 6mali insects , but their chief food was honey , and later strong sugar water , since the honey thinned with water often settled to the bottom of the dish . They thrived finely ou the sugar water , too . As the weather liecamc warm in J unc , tlie gauze covering was entirely removed from their glass palace and the little creatures were given the range of the whole room , but their food was always placed in their old dwelling . Tna tiny birds were not at all timor ous , even at first ; they did not flutter about anxious when their flowers were removed and fresh ones brought . Their eyes said plainly : We know you arc good to us . ” They thankfully appre ciated the care of their protector , and , although they manifested no uneasiness when strangers were in the room , they could not be induced to perch upon any anybody s linger but tlia : of their tender keeper . At the end of September one of them began to be aiiiDg , and a few days after was found dead upon tbe floor . The other pined from hour to hour , and when the cooler nights at the end of October approached it too succumbed to the un friendly climate and to its plainly mani fested homesickness . A DARING OUTLAW . LEADER OF BLACK JACK S GANG OF BANDITS . Ucld FT p a Train Single Handed and Afterward Fought a Dcspe > rate llattle with Officers — Killed Two Hundred Men . The notorious leader of the infamous Black Jack s ” gang of train robbeis and murderers , Tom Ketchum , now lies ia the hospital of the penitentiary at Santa Fe , N . M . , seriously wounded , as the result of an encounter with offi cers of the law . Tom held up a train single handed and in the sequel to this was wounded and captured . It was the Colorado Southern express that Tom held up . The place selected was near Fulsom , on the northeast corner of New Mexico . One night ns the ex press was puffing laboriously up grade the engineer saw a light ahead giving the signal to stop . When the train slowed down Tom Ketchum jumped into the cab and , carelessly swinging a 45 Colt near the engineer s nose , told him to obey all orders given during the next few minutes . This , Tom said , would save heartaches in the engineer s home and the intrusion of an under taker in the family circle . Then he Jumped off and tried to uncouple the engine , which was made impossible by the steep grade . Failing in this , Tom walked back to the Wells Fargo ex press car and , thumping the door with the butt of his Colt , demanded admit tance . The messenger opened the door and poked the muzzle of a Winchester out into the dark and pulled the trig ger . That put an end to the hold up that night . Just how badly Tom was shot Is not known , but he was wound ed in a subsequent battle with United States Marshal Foraker s posse and he will not say how much damage the messenger did . As he declared the hold up off it is probable he was se verely injured . The express pulled on and Tom Jumped his broncho and sought safety in the mountains . The attempted robbery was soon known to the officials and three days later Mar shal Foraker s men were hunting for Tom in the uplands . They finally lilt the trail and followed it hack into the very heart of the mountains . Here they lost it and while discussing the best move a report of a rifle split the air and one of the deputies fell out of his saddle . This was sufficient evi dence of Tom s presence in the vicin ity , but not his exact whereabouts , as Tom used smokeless cartridges . An other shot was heart and another depu ty went to the ground . At this rate every man In the posse would be cut down without a ghost of a chance of getting a shot . The deputies , there fore , separated , and began to scout the brush . A glint of sunshine playing on the blue steel barrels of a Winchester discussed Tom Ketchum s position be hind a big bowlder surrounded by brushwood . Then the day s proceed ings began . The deputies shot at that glint of sunshine playing along blue steel ; Tom shot at the deputies . The deputies dodged behind trees and rocks and shot wildly . Tom stayed where he was and made bull eyes . If Tom hadn t shelved his right arm a little too high in taking aim he would have brought down a full mess of deputies . As it was a slug of lead as big as your finger tore through Tom s shooting member , and it took a few minutes to change his Winchester over to his left arm . In these short minutes the deputies closed In on Tom and cap tured him . He was In a bad shape . His right arm was terribly broken and torn and he was already suffering from loss of blood . But he was game . Ho offered to take his left arm and begin the performance all over again , which proposition was respectfully declined . The next day when he was able to be moved Tom was strapped to his bron cho and taken to a train , ultimately landing in the penitentiary hospital at Santa Fe . Of Black Jack s \" gang of thieves and cutthroats Tom Ketchum was the leader . He was 35 years old , and in Texas , his native state , he is known as the new Jesse James . He stands 5 feet 10 inches In his stocking feet and is built on the graceful lines of a tiger . He is as void of conscience as the Winchester he carried . He would rather shoot a man than eat if the man be an officer of the law it was more fun to kill him than to go to a dance . One of his boyhood pas times was to hire in some convenient place on the ranch in Texas and shoot Mexican herdsmen . When a lad he was summoned as a witness in a law suit , and not knowing what the sum mons meant , and not caring to take any chances , shot and killed the officer . After this he found it convenient to change his residence , so he rode up into New Mexico and Arizona . Here he soon became a terror to everybody in general and railroad and express sompanies In particular . Ho admits in a roundabout way that since 1S88 he and his gang have stolen from post offices , trains , stages and wayfarers $200,000 and killed 200 men . COLORADO NOTES .

The Republican party is the party of Lincoln and Grant , whoso work in their respective spheres saved republicanism not alone in America , but for all the world . The rebellion was the crucial test of tho ability of a self governing nation to stand the strain of inter necine strife . The cost of saving the Union was fearful . The land was liillocked with graves , the blood of heroes flowed on a hun dred battlefields , the nation was exhausted , but the flag was not furled , and not a single star was lost from its azure field . The re sult , however , was worth all it cost . It was a struggle for integrity of empire , and yet it was a struggle against imperialism . The triumph of the North made thrones across the sea rock on their old found ations , and some , indeed , have fallen , while those which still re main have only been able to endure by granting a larger measure of self government , to their subjects . Manhood has become a royal thing due to the efforts of the Republican party to dignify and verify the sovereignty of manhood . Power has drifted down to tho masses , who became conscious of their power through the work of such men as Lincoln , Grant , Garfield , Harrison and McKinley , who , in camp , in battle and in tho councils of the nation have made our coun try the envy of the world . Tho policy of the Republican party has gone on in ndvanco of the carrying some of the blessings of liberty to peoples and countries who have never seen the banner of glory and freedom . To charge imperialism to the party which was conceived by freemen , was rocked by liberty and grew to vig orous maturity on tho strong meat of personal sovereignty , is to dis tort history , deny the truth and be tray the fact that the opponents of the party think a falsehood is bet ter than the truth for campaign purposes . A large part of Bryan s St . Louis audience on Saturday night left the hall long before he got through talk ing . This is ominous . In 189C lie held crowds for hours here , as he did else where throughout tin * country . No body saw any of ills auditors leave his meetings four years ago until he left . The change is significant . In the first place , the curiosity which led persons to go and see Bryan four years ago is necessarily less active now . In the second place , the chances of ills election are much fainter now than they seemed to be in 1800 . In the third place , the country is getting tired of his continual menace to business and prosperity by Bryan s free silver movement . This year will see the end of Bryan and Bryauism .

Under ordinal y circumstances news that an Indian tribe is Indulging in the wild frenzy known aa the ghowt dance is enough to call up visions of murder and rapine . In past days num erous murderous raids of the red men have been preceded by such festival . But a ghost dance now being held in the Wichita and Kiowa reservations of Indian territory is not believed to presage any such terrible scenes . The reservations named are to be opened to white settlers when the allotment of lands to Indians shall have been completed , and the red men fear that once the paleface gets in among them the days of tribal power will have been numbered . With the view of preventing the Impending Incursion thepe older chiefs have organized the ghost dance , which will , they hope , serve to keep the white men away . Blank ! , the leader of the ghost dance , is & high priest in his tribe and a dreamer as well . He is a quiet man etween 60 and 60 years of age , of dignified manner and with a thought ful countenance , according well with his tribal positions as chief priest and head man .

The goddess and her priests have prepared the entertainment , and a city in our midst has been selected for its production . It is frep to everybody . The goddess has maintained ber usual secrecy , this year , on the question of her theme . The subject is said to be of great simplicity and grandeur , however , and it will as suredly be illustrated in a splendid manner . It is expected that Pallas will arrive in New York with her train , about September 29 , taking six special coaches on tbe New York Central road , direct to Kansas City . Visitors should reach the scene of the grand entertainment not later than 8 o clock , on the evening of October 2 . Specimen Cases . S . H .

For many years there has been a bear extant m this country , seeking whom he might devour by springing upon the unsuspected , from.his dark biding places . He has been a terror to men , women and children . He has rendered desolate many a borne . He has broken the domestic peace and happm ? s9 , and caused more sorrow and heart rendering than all the evils combined , and he has con tinued in his mad career , without check or remorse of conscience to ! ay waste this beautiful domain of ours , until two plucky men in a hand to hand fight choksd the very exist ence out of * him . This bear , dear reader , is high prices , and Stephens & Trammel are the men who killed him .

Gold beaters , by hammering , can reduce gold leaves to such thinness that 282,000 must be laid upon each other to produce the thickness of an inch . Yet each leaf is so perfect and free from holes that one of them laid on any surface , as in gilding , has the appearance of solid gold . They are so thin that if formed into a book 1,500 would only occupy the space of a single leaf of paper . A single volume of a gold leaf book one inch in thickness would have as many pages as an entire library of 1,500 volumes of common books , even though the volumes averaged 400 pages each . A . C . MATTEE.SON DEAD Well Known Farmer Passes Away AfUr Much neral on Wedding An niversary . • Four years to the day after his marriage to Miss May Struppler , A . Matt arson was buried in the ceme tery - west of town . After enduring weeks of suffering in the hospital at , , with no hopes of relief ex cept in death . Mr . Matterson passed to the great unknown last Sunday at ! ) o clock , and the funeral was held in Pullman Monday afternoon . The body arrived at 3 o clock and was taken to the Congregational church , where services were conduct ed by Rev . C . H . Harrison , the pas tor . Tho Masons of Pullman met the body at the depot and acted as es cort and pallbearers . Mr . Matterson was a respected member of the local Masonic lodge . He was 34 years old and had been married just four years . He leaves a wife and two chil dren . aged two and a half and one year , and a great many friends to mourn his departure . Mr . Matterson came here from New York about eight years ago . He worked for Dan iel Struppler for several years and married Mr . Struppler s daughter .

The writer Is convinced that hens fre quently become overfat from under ex ercise and the feeding of too mud ! . orn . He remembers one such hen hat when dressed yielded five pounds of worthless fat and was reduced by the removal of the fat from ten to flvs pounds In weight . Not only are such birds rendered worthless for egg pro Juction , but they also are rendered worthless for anything else . An over abundance of fat Is an unhealthy in dication and opens the way to the coni ng of various diseases . It Is as detri mental to tho breeding fowl as It it to the laying fowl . OUR POSTAL SYSTEM . President Taft s recommenda tion that the rates on second class postage matter he increased to meet tin 1 deficit of the post office department has raised a hornets nest , brought about an exhaus tive discussion of the workings of the department and aroused a de mand for a thorough investigation of its methods , including the rates paid the railroads , the franking system , the rent paid lor mail ears , ami the feasibility of a parcels post system . It is difficult to understand why in Canada , a country as wide as the l 11 it eel States and far less densely popidated , the govern ment . made such a large profit in handling second class matter at a half a cent a pound that the rate was reduced to a quarter cent a pound , while our department has been losing $8,000,000 a year . It is equally hard to comprehend how the express companies can handle packages at less rates than the post office department and still be able to declare dividends running as high as 300 per cent . Neither can the average citizen understand why the post office department should pay for rent of mail coaches each year , the full cost of building those coaches . It is even more difficult to comprehend why an 11 pound package can he sent by mail from New York to Japan for 12 cents a pound , while a four pound pack age sent from New York to Al bany would require 16 cents a pound postage , or how the Ger man postal service can make a success of handling all sorts of parcels up to a 100 pound trunk at one third of a cent a pound . John Brisben Walker discusses several of these questions in an analysis of postal conditions pre pared for the American Newspa per Publishers ’ Association , in which he says in part The average express haul to day is less than thirty eight miles . This is because trade is largely carried on with those living near by . If the government carried par cels at even one cent a pound it would get the hundreds of mil lions of packages sent out by the great , dry goods houses . This would probably reduce the aver age haul ’ to twenty miles or less . The United States Govern ment is already equipped with more than 60,000 completely or ganized stations . These have their managers and clerks , their ren tals . heat , and light , their detec tive and legal services already paid for . To handle parcels would cost nothing additional in tens of thousands of post offices except the wagon haul in the lo cality . . . putting all into one class and ac cepting packages up to 200 pounds weight . The government is spending more than $32,000,000 annually on a country delivery service , which the Postmaster General re ports as carrying only 25 pounds per trip per wagon . Each of these wagons could carry from 500 to 700 pounds per daily trip each way . At one cent a pound this sor v ce instead of being conducted at an almost total loss , as now , would he clearing tens of mil lions . The wagon that now car ries only 25 pounds , loaded each way with 500 more pounds at a rent a pound , would bring in a day additional . I am firmly of the opinion that eventually the Government will realize that the rate charged in third of a cent a pound—will be found sufficient . But for the present 1 would urge the passage of a law making one cent a pound the rate for all mer j j . j . SCHERK . chandise , books and periodicals — | 701 Riverside , THE NORTHWEST Captain T . D . Bloni , prominent in shipping circles and head of a codfish company , was found in Wright park , in the heart of the city of Tacotna , last , week , with his throat cut . He will probably die . It Is believed he was at tacked by a robber while on the way to the home of a friend . The attack is supposed to have been made some time before midnight and Blom is be lieved to have lain in the park all night . When found his condition was desperate . Several square feet of sod were covered with blood and there were indications of a struggle . In a fire which desrroyed the home of Jos . C . Wendell located in the sub urbs of Portland , Myrtle Wendell , aged 2 years , was burned to death , and Laura Ellis , a domestic , aged IS years , was so badly burned that she died a few minutes after she reached the hospital . It is believed the fire started from the explosion of a gas oline stove . None of the members of the family were home when the fire broke out and it was some time be fore the nearest neighbors could reach the scene , it was then too late to save either of the victims . Two journeyman plumbers out of a job held up and shot Charles Jeakel , a horseshoer of Lewiston , Idaho , through the neck at . Marshal Junction atabout 8 o clock Saturday night , securing $35 and inflicting a serious wound .

Mc Clellan is one of the best known or ganists in America , and lias recently been elected vice president , of the American Association of Organists .

The key desk is in the orchestra pit . There have been many inquiries from all parts of the Inland Empire about the date of tlie opening recit al , and the attendance will probably he larger than for any other attrac tion ever held in Pullman . The col lege is exceedingly fortunate in se curing a man of Mr . McClellan s ability for the opening . THE GOVERNMENT AND THE MINER Enormous Sums Spent Every Year fi r the Farmers , How About the Miners and Their Interests ? . .

The Twentieth cen ury wanderers traveled by special train instead of a foot , and they did not crosB tike Red sea . Instead of Pharaoh and his hosts perverse fate pursued them . Tfcla group of unfortunate Jews are a faw of the more than 6,000,000 who are be ing provided with emergency relief from funds raised by the American Jewish Relief Committee and kindred organizations . The story of their ex periences , as told in the Zionist report from Jerusalem , is as follows big problem of < 4he month has been that of caring for the refugees returning from Egypt . They have come back to Jerusalem , which is not ready to absorb them economically or to give them housing accommodations . Their return was accompanied with difficulties and tribulations . The train broke down on the * line , and the ref ugees were left without food or care for twenty four hours . Later it was stalled on a siding , when it exper ienced a head on collieion , which in jured a number of refugees . Finally , when they did reach Jeru salem and were being cared for In ths house which we had taken for them , some of their children found a Turkish bomb in the upper story of the bouse and played with It . The bomb exploded , killing one child and wounding fonr others . We are at present faced with the problem of adjusting the adults to Jerusalem economic life .

WOMEN IN THE WORLD S PROG RESS A woman who has achieved much , in the world s recent most valued discoveries , is Madam Sklodowsky Curie , who with her late husband discovered radium and Its wonderful uses . Much has been written of the use of radium in the curing of the dread disease , cancer . The official announcement in August that the State of New York had purchased two grams and a quarter of radium for the free treatment of cancer , begin ning Oct . 15 , also to treat other allied malignant diseases , and that this tiny amount of the rare and super precious metal is enough to treat two billion patients , is wonderful statement to be found in an article entitled Science and Discovery ” in the October number of Current His tory . This also gives the use of ra dium in wireless messages , in air planes , and states tAa Madam Curie has recently discovered a new meth od of using it . Madam Curie is the one foremost scientific explorer and successful discoverer of the world . The triumph of Woman s Suffrage brings women to the front in the po litical arena , with their wings as yet untried , but no doubt they prove their w orth in this line of work , as they have in other lines in the past century . It can no longer be said , they must not vote unless they would fight , for the famous Woman s Battalion of Death in Russia proved that women can fight for a cause to h xe last ditch , meeting death and worse than death with a courage un conquered . A very charming woman politician in our midst recently , Miss Chari Williams , proved that a woman can have the entire political situation at her tongue s end , and can give out his informatiofi to an audience with dignity , womanly modesty , yet w r ith splendid force and with the con vincing method of instruction that proves her to have been a successful teacher as well as having successful ly filled the place of superintendent of public Instruction for Shelby coun ty for eight years . Miss Williams spoke with ease and handled the po litical questions , t , b.e League of Na tions and other subjects pertinent to the present election with ease , dignity and power . When such women are willing to forge to the front , then may we not at least be willing to cast our votes for the good men to rule our country , our state and our town .

Limestone Quarries of State Form Study Sites for Wayne U . Students About 350 million years ago Mich igan lay under a great inland sea , in whose salty waters lived billions of tiny creatures . As they died , their shells and skeletons sank to the bottom , and later were covered by earth . Today the sea ia gone , and the marine deposits have become com pact layers which we know as lime stone . An important resource in itaelf , this limestone ia also a pro tective covering for other under ground treasure , says Dr . Willard H . Parsons of Wayne University s geology department in Detroit Limestone formations stretch be low the surface of every county in Michigan , he points out In th Lower Peninsula tha formations ar shaped like a stack of shallow howls , with the deepest portions at th center of the atate . In thia deep buried portion , Mich igan s oil and gaa deposits ar * found . Sealed far beneath th * surface and held in th * porous limestone layers , the oil pools and gas pockets remain until tapped , as in Isabella , Midland , Gladwin , and Barry Count . The limestone deposits in these interior areas are thus more important a sealed pouches for natural treasures than aa quarry sites . It is M th * bowls \\' edges in the lake bordered counties — , Wayne , Huron , Arenac , Alpena , Presque Isle , Cheboygan , Emmet , and Charlevoi * • that limestone quarrying itaelf ia most profitable Hera the limeetone ia close to th surface , and near cheap water trans portation . In tha Upper Peninsula , as in the Lower , quarry sites have been chosen near water transport , with Mackinsc and Schoolcraft Counties noteworthy centers . Outcropping occur in many Upper Peninsula spots , however , forming some of the scenic wonders of th * tree , like the Burnt Bluffs near Fayette . Aware of limestone s importance . 600 Wayne University students will make field trip * to various quarries within th * state this year . They will be studying Michigan s gW white wealth of stone—basic ingre dient in th making of iron , fe rtl liters , chemicals , and building m teriala : and • foundation stone of Michigan s prosperity . DIXIELAND JAZZ GETS NATION S EAR AGAIN NEW YORK . All over the na tion . Dixieland Jazz is hot again , is the disclosure of Joseph Roddy in the June fl issue of Look Mag azine . The great new temples , such as Birdland and Bop City , dedicated to the new jazz , are losing their congregations , he finds . As a native American art form , Dixieland is a lot of things to a lot of people . ” it is explained . To the jazz purist , his definition states , it is a ritually stylized way of playing a hallowed set of hollers , work songs , spirituals , blues and marches . \" Most of them existed before 1920 . Their idio logical point of origin is New Or leans . he says . Record companies are reissuing some of the best work * of old Dixieland greats , many of them Negroes . What caused the revival of Dixieland jazz is a mystery . Roddy credits disk jockeys in va rious cities with helping the re vival . Killed on Assignment ALBERT HINTON , one of the four war correspond ents believed to have bc en occupants in a C 47 military transport plane with 26 persons aboard that plunged into the sea last Thursday about 10 miles south of Oshima Island , is cited as one of the most capable of Negro journalists . Hinton was managing editor of the Norfolk Journal and Guide newspaper which is published in Norfolk , Ya . , site of the world s largest harbor . The Guide ” is generally referred to by newsmen as the best edited of race sheets . ” Hinton , while doing some outstanding reporting , is not well known as perhaps some other news writers whose experiences have not been as broad . This is probably due to his quiet , un assuming nature a trait which has proved a valuable asset towards news gath ering . Among his prominent assignments were coverage of the Columbia . Tennessee riots and the expose of the grossly unequal and primitive ” school system for Ne groes in the county adjoining Norfolk . THE MANAGING EDITOR used to verenelv stop his work which was directed on two or three piles of news copy ” to give me tips on the how or why of certain ways of handling the news . During one of these disturbances ” he evidentally thought he needed a break and started revealing some of his experiences at the Columbia , Tenn . riots trial . Deftly skilled at use of adjectives . Hinton told of the meting of two newspapermen , members of separate big , race weeklies , in Atlanta . Ga . . Upon hearing that he was heading to cover the Columbia riots , both in an uncomfortably manner stated that they were just so disappointed ” that they had other assignments not to be able to accompany him . U was that hot , too , ” Hinton stated . The atmos phere was so loaded , particularly after the obscene woid , N r , was used frequently by the prosecuting at torney and the judge , that I and another race corre spondent grabbed a hired car after the trial and headed for freedom ’ which was in the next county about 15 miles away . HINTON FOR HIS EXPOSE of the unsanitary and fu and equipped school system won the Wendell Willkie award for public service for the Guide . ” These are just two of a long list of assign ments that he could do brilliantly . No doubt that his death was as he would have it resulting while on assignment for the Guide and the National Negro Press Association to report the news . Ravens on Vacation NEW YORK . — The Ravens , America s premier novelty and harmony quartette , are enjoying a well earned vacation after an uninterrupted stretch of eleven straight months of unceasing ac tivity in theatres , nite clubs and dance halls from coast to coast . Leader Jimmy Ricks gave the boys the welcome news of a long hiatus following the completion of their engagement in the Pic adilly Club in nearby Newark . The singers will resume activ ity with a long rehearsal siege , durng which time they will wade through a mountain of submitted material to pick items for their initial fall recording sessions . l HClul ) Girl at White House Charlotte Ingram , outstanding 4 H club girl of Ellendale , Del . joined with 4 H er Mary Ann Long of hSelby . Va . , and Mrs , Franklin D Roosevelt in present ing the first homemade United Nations Flag to President Harry S . Truman at the White House recently . This ceremony was first of a series of UN flag presentations which wil be made to local of ficials by sewing groups in thous ands of communities throughout the country for flying on October 24th , United Nations Day . White and colored home dem onstration agents will take the lead in \\' developing plans for making and presenting the flags , according to M . L . Wilson , direc tor of Extension Work for the U . S . Department of Agriculture . New YWCA Courses Three additional courses will be offered by the YWCA in No vember when late fall classes begin . Skiing and supervised bad minton play will be new on the list of class * at Central Branch YW . These classes are open to both men and women .

A five weeks class in posture relaxation will start there on Nov . 7 . Classes opening in November at the three other YWCA branches will include bridge , china painting , cookery , roller skating , judo , millinery , tennis , square dancing , golf , bowling , modern dance , swimming and gymnastics . All are eight week classes with the exception of golf and bowling . Registration for these classes may be made at any of the Witherell and Montcalm Sts . Highland Park Branch , 13139 Woodward ; and Lucy Thurman Branch , 569 East Elizabeth . Thanks and Giving T housands of individual ! at this Thanksgiving season are grateful for the blessings which are theirs , yet disturbed by the needs of other . There Is so much trouble and want in the world , ” they remark , but what can 1 do ? What can you do ? More per haps than > ou think—even with out money or worldly power or political influence . AJi can help by means of scientific prayer , the kind of prayer given to the world nearly two thousand year * ago by Christ Jesus . He had no fortune to distribute to the needy , no endowed insti tutions to call upon for assist ance , no worldly prestige . Yet he healed the sick , fed the hungry , met the demands of the tax col lectors , even raised the dead all through understanding , scien tific prayer . . . . When the centurion at Caper naum asked the Master to heal his servant , he pleaded iMatthew 8 H > , Speak the word only , and my servant shall be healed . Jesus commended his faith and said , Go thy way ; and as thou bast believed , so be it done unto thee . \" The narrative continues , His servant was healed in the selfsame hour . There was no need to journey to the bedside of the sick man . No need for Jesus to take one footstep in any direction . He did not send medical supplies or food or money . He applied the truth he knew of God and man . He under stood the nature of man made in the image and likeness of God . And he said ( John 14 12 ) , He that believeth on me , the works that I do shall he do also . Mary Baker Eddy , the Discov erer and Founder of Christian Science , writes in Science and Health with Key to the Scrip tures * ( p . 494 ) way « haa met and always will meet every human need . It Is not well to imagine that Jesus dem onstrated the divine power to heal only for a select number or for a limited period of time , since to all mankind and in every hour , divine Love supplies all good . The writer has had ample evi dence of the far reaching effect of Christian Science . Even dur ing her school days she w as many times protected , healed , and guided by the prayers , the spirit ual understanding , of a Christian Scientist living three thousand miles away , in another country . Neither time nor space can inter fere with the operation of God s law . . . . The understanding that God , divine Spirit , Infinite good , is All and that man is His reflection , hence spiritual and perfect , ac complishes such healings . Right thinking from the basis of this truth of God and man benefits all . Such prayer , based on spiritual understanding , welling from a heart cleansed of pride and self seeking , blesses the world . Such prayer does not prohibit or prevent the giving of right material aid to others or justify us in turning aside from any practical way in which we may minister to the needy . On the contrary , the deeds we do should illustrate the truth we know . But nothing can measure the spir itual power for good of selfless , silent right thinking . '"
